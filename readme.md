# CloseActPlugin
This small plugin designed to do only two small things:
* Minimize ACT on startup;
* Close ACT on FFXIV exit.
* Gracefully close ACT on FFXIV exit.

Normally stuff like this could be done without plugin using built-in tools provided by Windows, however, because of complex nature of ACT main window, it's easier and more reliable to do so using plugin.

## Known issues
* Will not work properly if more than one copy of FFXIV is running simultaneously. 
## Automatically starting ACT on FFXIV launch
Please use [FFXIV Quick Launcher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) to do that.
